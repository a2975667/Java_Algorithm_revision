#Java tips
This is just a place to mark down the things I don't want to forget.
Especially when switching around different languages...

#Basic things
##Array
Array declearation:
```java
int[] name = new int[]{1,2,3}
int[] name = new int[]
```
**java does not support inline init, either use a loop or a libray call**

#Basic Data Structures
##Trees
First we build the nodes of the tree
```java
public class Tree<T>{

}
