#Java tips
This is just a place to mark down the things I don't want to forget.
Especially when switching around different languages...

#Basic things
**Array declearation:**
```java
int[] name = new int[]{1,2,3}
int[] name = new int[3]
```
*java does not support inline init, either use a loop or a libray call*

**Stack**
remember to import libraries for the basic Data Structure:
```java
import java.util.*
```
